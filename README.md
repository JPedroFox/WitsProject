Development of a 2D video game in Godot: programming techniques and interactive design

The project represents the complete creation of a 2D top-down video game developed with the Godot engine. The goal was to deepen fundamental aspects of programming, interactive design and game design, integrating technical elements such as the artificial intelligence of enemies, the damage and health system,
User interface management (HUD), customizable audio and saving encrypted statistics. Work puts into practice transverse skills such as problem solving, file management, scripting in GDScript and game logic, demonstrating the concrete application of computer skills in a creative and stimulating context.
